# Hippie: Block the AI!
### v0.0.1

## Introduction
Hippie is very simply a small, python based program to automate blocking and/or making AI harder to use.

From it's very conseption Hippie was anti-ai, of course with some recognition of it's protential as a *tool*. At this stage (As of 30/11/2025) in AI's life we're already seeing some affects on many profesonals; in a lot of cases AI looks to be turning our brains to mush (depending on the useage).

## Philosophy
Hippie is guided by the following pricipals:

1. Hippie should be able to be used by a five year-old, and for them to be able to understand, and explain it!
2. Hippie must be able to be extended by/for advanced users. (This may look like an "advanced mode" setting)
3. At no point should Hippie become closed source
